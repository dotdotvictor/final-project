# final-project phys360
final project for physics 360


### Idea for the final project

Creating gravitational slingshots to explore the changes in trajectory between planets while also attempting to have an object at a starting point reach a target far out from space in a system of planets. 

### Motivation for Project
I have found it interesting how satellites are launched into space, where it is usualyl 

### Questions 
What would the trajectory look like if an object passed through the orbit of a planet that had a large mass versus a small mass?


changing the masses of the objects to explore how it changes trajectory

### Resources
I found an article where the author had created a [similar project](https://pages.vassar.edu/magnes/2016/12/11/gravity-assist/) using gravity assist. 
There is a page from [NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/learn/basics-of-space-flight/primer/) that describes how gravity assist works, and how Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 applied these manuevers in space.
