# Final Project Phys360

### Idea for the final project

Creating gravitational slingshots to explore the changes in trajectory between planets while also attempting to have an object at a starting point reach a target far out from space in a system of planets. 


### Brief Summary

Updating the trajectory and the orbiting of the planets around the Sun or a star can be done using the Euler-Cromer method. These planets can be modeled after the planets in our solar system. The spacecraft may have to approach each planet at a specific angle or at a certain velocity or it was escape from the system. 



### Motivation for Project
I have found it interesting how gravity can be used to launch satellites and spacecraft into space, and I wanted to see if it was possible for me to create a model that could mimic the journey of Voyager 1 and 2. During my PHYS151 lab, I programmed a spacecraft flying and reaching a planet by accounting for its trajectory. Now, I want to see if I could do the same for a system of planets. 


### Questions 
What would the trajectory look like if an object passed through the orbit of a planet that had a large mass versus a small mass?

What if the mass or starting velocity of the spacecraft was varied? 

What if there was a reverse trip involved where the spacecraft had to return back to Earth?

What is the fastest time for a spacecraft to reach its target destination using gravity assist (exploring the changes in position of planets)

How many times can gravity assist be used in the model?



### Resources
I found an article where the author had created a [similar project](https://pages.vassar.edu/magnes/2016/12/11/gravity-assist/) using gravity assist. 
There is a page from [NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/learn/basics-of-space-flight/primer/) that describes how gravity assist works, and how Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 applied these manuevers in space.
