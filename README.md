# final-project
final project for physics 360

Some ideas for the final project:

gravitational slingshots and changing the masses of the objects to explore how it changes trajectory

examining the spectras of atoms, and what would happen if you mixed these atoms together, what type of spectra could be seen or produced to show on a diagram. 

What happens to a penny if it falls from a tall building? What would happen if the penny was spinning or if there was different ways it fell. 

Exploring the characteristics of electric fields...
